# Ransomware

PHP ransomware that encrypts your files as well as file and directory names.

Ransomware is set to start encrypting files and directories from server web root directory and only inside server web root directory.

In case you forgot your encryption key you can find it hardcoded inside ransom page. View page source code in your web browser and search for keyword `recovery`, there you will find your encryption/decryption key.

Care not to do damage! Backup your server files before running ransomware!

Made for educational purposes. I hope it will help!
